#This is a list of tools that was used during Forensics and with each tool is a quick description, review of usage, and a url if needed.

1. Autopsy
For most of the labs, I used this tool. I created cases to analyze the different parts of the local disk image. It comes with features like Timeline Analysis, Hash Filtering, File System Analsis and Keyword. I loved this tool, very simple to use for how much information was involved with the lab. Easy to navigate and can be quickly and easily learned.

2. WinPrefetch
A light gui that is used to analyze quickly Windows Prefetch information and showing when the executable was first run and and other times it was run afterwards on the system. I used this tool mostly in the Memory Analysis lab, I found an executable file running Powershell that harbored a Empire Rootkit. I would recommend this tool to a beginning forensic investigator when looking for anything malicious. 
 
3. FTK Imager
This is a forensics piece of software that scans a hard drive looking for different kinds of information. It has a great ability to locate deleted files, scan disks for different files containing pertinent information about how a system was breached and anything malicious uploaded to the system. This particular tool was particularly challenging to grasp. Compared to Autospy, FTK seemed scattered with tools.

4. Volatility
Based on Python, Volatility is an open source software program that analyzes RAM. It supports analysis for the four main operating systems used: Linux, Windows, Mac, and Android. It also has the ability to analyze raw dumps & virtual dumps. The way this tool was used was in a lab based on Seizing information and files from a computer that had become compromised. Using this tool, RAM was captured and all different running processes. I would use this tool again.
